    <h2>Subtheme: Transit-Oriented Development</h2>
    <h3>Initial Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Which neighborhoods or areas of Boston have the lowest density of MBTA stops, and how does the existence of these sparse patches demonstrate the inequities in access to public transportation and therefore housing affordabilities?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Motivation 1:</b> In the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/transport/publication/transforming-the-urban-space-through-transit-oriented-development-the-3v-approach">World Bank Group 3V Article</a>, one of the benefits of transit-oriented development is that it leads to concentration of housing around public transport stations, which creates communities with shorter commutes. If an area is sparse in public transit stops, residents in that area have less access to public transportation, which can increase household transportation costs. This could make housing less affordable even if the base costs are low, due to added costs elsewhere. Thus, mapping out MBTA stop density and identifying the areas across Boston with suboptimal transit infrastructure will spotlight areas where future TOD investments could have the greatest impact on improving affordability.

                    <b>Motivation 2:</b> A real-life situation also inspired me to consider this research question. A family I'm close to lives in Arlington and they're hoping to move to another home nearby, but they're struggling to find a place close to public transit. This is striking because Arlington and neighboring towns are close suburbs to a big city, Boston, and one might expect such cities to be well-connected, yet this family describes relying on Ubers or driving to go anywhere from all of the options they've looked at so far. As a result of these difficulties, the need to find a home near a T stop has become a major setback in their search for a new home. I hope that, by mapping out the MBTA stop distribution across the close suburbs of Boston, I can visualize just how uneven the coverage is in these areas (much sparser), which will help me better understand the difficulties that families face when trying to buy houses with transit access.

            How does the spacing between MBTA stations vary across different lines, and what might this suggest about which areas would be more inducive to compact and pedestrian-/bicycle-friendly development?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Motivation 1:</b> In the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/transport/publication/transforming-the-urban-space-through-transit-oriented-development-the-3v-approach">World Bank Group 3V Article</a>, one of the main goals of TOD is creating urban areas that are "compact...[and] pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly". Station spacing matters because more closely-spaced stations lead to more pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly areas between them widely-spaced stations. Closely-spaced stations create more continuously-walkable intervals between and around them. This is good for if people want to access amenities between the stations. On the other hand, widely-spaced stations would often lead to more car-oriented development, since getting between and around them would often require traveling more than a pedestrian or cyclist can feasibly do. Thus, calculating station spacings can help identify areas of more or less continuously-walkable intervals, enabling developers to determine optimal areas for housing development (and potentially suggesting to MBTA officials the lines and stations that need potential improvement).

                    <b>Motivation 2:</b> A real-life situation also inspired me to consider this research question. The quickest way to transfer from the <a style="color: red">red line</a> to the <a style="color: blue">blue line</a> when leaving from Kendall/MIT is to transfer to the <a style="color: green">green line</a> at Park Street, get off at Government Center, the transfer to the <a style="color: blue">blue line</a>. However, one day, the green line was down, but since the walk from Park Street to Government Center isn't long, I was able to still complete the transfer. This demonstrates how closely-spaced stations (in this case, Park Street and Government Center along the <a style="color: green">green line</a>) can make traveling more friendly for pedestrians and cyclists. It's my hope that, by calculating station-spacings, I can determine more positive and negative examples.

            Which MBTA stations function as the most important connectors in the network based on the number of lines that intersect there, and what pattern do these major transferring hubs form across the city?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Motivation 1:</b> A real-life situation inspired me to consider this research question. When trying to get between places on the various subway lines, it's important to consider where I can transfer between them, since some of the lines (for example, the <a style="color: red">red line</a> and the <a style="color: blue">blue line</a>) do not intersect at any stations, meaning that I need to transfer via a line that connects them (for example, getting on the <a style="color: green">green line</a> at Park Street). The described process is often a hassle, and having to transfer can significantly increase travel time. Thus, living close to a major connector could be very convenient, reducing costs such as travel time. By mapping out the stations and categorizing them based on how many lines they connect, I can find the stations with the most connections, thus identifying the best stations for potential development.

                    <b>Motivation 2:</b> In the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/transport/publication/transforming-the-urban-space-through-transit-oriented-development-the-3v-approach">World Bank Group 3V Article</a>, one of the 3 V's is node value, which is "the importance of a station in the public transit network". The article specifically names one of the ways to determine importance as "connections with other transport modes". This means that stations with more connections have a higher node value, which makes them potentially good candidates for TOD, since living close to such a station can provide many benefits to the residents.
