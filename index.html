    <h3>Dataset: Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</h3>
    <p>
        This dataset provides an overview of housing ownership trends across Boston's neighborhoods over a 20-year span (2004-2024), tracking both the corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates each year using Boston's property assessment data.The dataset is also augmented with US Census data of each neighborhood's racial demographics, housing distribution, and age structure, allowing for an examination of the correlation between various ownership trends and demographic statistics.
    </p>
    <h3>Initial Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Question 1: Which neighborhoods have experienced the most dramatic increases in corporate ownership rates since 2004, and how do these changes correlate with the dominant racial demographics of these neighborhoods?</b> 
            <p>
                According to the <a href="https://vis-society.github.io/theme/evictions.html">first paragraph of the subtheme page</a>, prior research indicates that corporate landlords evict tenants at higher rates than landlords living on or near the property, suggesting that rising corporate ownership rates is almost certainly a driver for high eviction rates and housing instability. Identifying neighborhoods that have experienced sharpest increases in corporate ownership rates can help pinpoint areas at greater risk for skyrocketing eviction rates that lead to housing affordability crises (finding a new place can be difficult for tenants with evictions on their record), and therefore more effectively determine prioritized targets for reform. Additionally, as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html?smid=pl-share">NYT article</a> highlights, eviction patterns sometimes have strong correlation with racial and other demographics, such as in Richmond, which is "a city where many poor African-Americans live in low-quality housing". Thus, investigating these relationships could also reveal underlying racial and other inequalities in the Boston housing market. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 2: What is the correlation between corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates across all of the Boston neighborhoods?</b>
            <p>
                Intuitively, corporate ownership and owner occupancy rates seem like they would usually be opposites, since only one type of landlord situation can be true at a time: a property cannot be both owned by a company and lived in by an individual owner. Confirming this inverse correlation and understanding its strength can reveal whether increasing corporate ownership rates directly correspond to decreasing owner occupancy (and individual landlords) rates, and vice versa, or if there are other confounding factors such as other types of ownership. Increasing corporate ownership rates matters because, as the <a href="https://vis-society.github.io/theme/evictions.html">first paragraph of the subtheme page</a> and prior research states, corporate landlords evict tenants at higher rates than landlords living on or near the property, suggesting that rising corporate ownership rates is almost certainly a driver for high eviction rates and housing instability. On the other hand, decreasing owner occupancy is also bad for landlords: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html?smid=pl-share">NYT article</a> implies that corporate ownership evictions are mass-handled in a poor manner, which can lead to agencies losing more money than they would from not receiving rent. This would not happen as much with individual landlords, since the eviction proceedings are not as streamlined and hurried. Thus, examining the relationship between the two metrics across Boston neighborhoods and over time will demonstrate whether the opposite changes truly occur in tandem, providing insight into the mechanisms behind shifting housing ownership in Boston and identifying the main (especially landlord and ownership related) causes behind the eviction crisis.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 3: Which neighborhoods have consistently maintained low corporate ownership rates throughout the 20 years of study, and what are their dominant racial demographics?</b> 
            <p>
                While most of the research so far, such as the case studies in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html?smid=pl-share">NYT article</a>, has centered on areas with rising corporate ownership and eviction rates, identifying and studying those with low corporate ownership rates is equally valuable. Neighborhoods that have maintained low corporate ownership rates over two decades can have potential protective factors that shield them from corporate development, and examining them could be useful when reforming more negatively-affected neighborhoods. Inspecting the racial demographics of these "success-story" neighborhoods contributes important information as well: if these low corporate ownership areas are usually mostly white, while neighborhoods of color have all experienced corporate ownership rate increases, this would further demonstrate the racial inequities in the housing situation in Boston.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Discoveries and Insights</h3>
    <p>We begin our study by examining the variables, assumptions, data quality issues, and preliminary relationships. Later, we will perform a more in-depth analysis to address our research questions.</p>
    <h4>Data Attributes, Patterns, and Relationships</h4>
    <p>First, we consider the attributes of the data. The dimensions are neighborhood, of which there are 21, and year, which ranges from 2004 to 2024. The measures are the 36 demographic categories, which range from race and age to occupation, and the two central rates: corporate ownership rate and owner occupancy rate.</p>
    <p>To gain a basic overview of the data distribution and trends, we plot the changes in corporate ownership rate and owner occupancy rate over time for each neighborhood as line graphs (see <b>Figure 1</b>). The horizontal axis is the time (year), and also indicates the neighborhood, while the vertical axis represents the corporate ownership rate and owner occupancy rate corresponding to that neighborhood and year.</p>
    <p>As shown in <b>Figure 1</b>, the corporate ownership rate increases dramatically over time for every neighborhood of Boston. This matches the general intuition, since increase in corporate ownership rate is often correlated with declining housing affordability due to increased eviction rates, and the latter has been a significant issue according to many sources (including the NYT article above). Additionally, neighborhoods and cities tend to experience corporatization over time, further justifying this result.</p>
    <p>Another trend is that the two rates mostly vary inversely--when corporate ownership rate increases, owner occupancy decreases, and vice versa. There are some exceptions to this trend (such as Chinatown and South Boston Waterfront) but it generally holds true for most of the Boston neighborhoods. This suggests a somewhat strong inverse correlation between the two rates, but it's not 100% accurate, leading us to wonder why the exceptions occurred.</p>

    <figcaption><b>Figure 1:</b> Line graphs of change of corporate ownership rate and owner occupancy rate over time for each neighborhood. The six images shown are horizontally-cropped segments of a single graph. The general trend for each neighborhood is that corporate ownership rate increases dramatically over time, and owner occupancy rate decreases. The first part of this trend is true for all neighborhoods, while the second part only applies to most of the neighborhoods, with a few exceptions such as Chinatown and South Boston Waterfront. This suggests a somewhat strong inverse correlation between the two rates, but it's not 100% accurate.</figcaption>
    <h4>Data Issues and Assumptions</h4>
    <p>Next, we look at the assumptions we make for this preliminary study, as well as acknowledge potential issues with the data. We notice that the value for each demographic category seems to be unchanged across the 20 year span for each neighborhood. To verify this observation, we plot the total population for each demographic category, summed across all Boston neighborhoods, for every year between 2004 and 2024 (see <b>Figure 2</b>). The x-axis represents time (year), while the y-axis represents the total population count for each demographic group.</p>
    <p>Since each group's line is horizontal across the entire time period, this confirms that the demographic data is indeed static across the entire study. This is somewhat corroborated by the fact that censuses are not taken every year, so some static data is to be expected. However, it was surprising that the data didn't change over 20 years since there's usually a census every 10 years. Regardless, this makes the data somewhat inaccurate, because there are bound to be demographic changes over a time period of 20 years--in fact, the demographic changes and ownership changes could strongly influence each other, meaning that omitting demographic changes removes a potentially significant causal relationship with the rate changes in the data. However, we will be "assuming" that the demographic data does not change over the span of this study, and add the other component into consideration in a later study.</p>
    <image src="images/fig-2-part-1.png" style="width:30%; height:30%;"></image>
    <image src="images/fig-2-part-2.png" style="width:30%; height:30%;"></image>
    <image src="images/fig-2-part-3.png" style="width:30%; height:30%;"></image>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 2:</b> Line graph of total population for each demographic category, summed across all Boston neighborhoods, for every year between 2004 and 2024. The three images shown are vertically-cropped segments of a single graph. Each line, which represents the sum across all Boston neighborhoods of each demographic value each year, is horizontal, meaning that the demographic values do not change over time for each neighborhood. This is inaccurate, because there are bound to be demographic changes over a time period of 20 years--in fact, the demographic changes and ownership changes could strongly influence each other, meaning that omitting demographic changes removes a potentially significant causal relationship with the rate changes in the data. However, we will be "assuming" that the demographic data does not change over the span of this study.</figcaption>
    <p>Our next assumption is one that somewhat limits the scope of our research study to ensure its depth. We mostly focus on the two rates and the racial demographic data, while only briefly analyzing the other types of demographic data. This doesn't compromise the quality of the data since the racial and other demographic data are not directly dependent on each other, and we do consider the other demographic data briefly. However, we keep in mind that there may be correlations between the other demographic data and the rate/racial demographic fields that could lead to different findings from the ones below, and not all of these were necessarily considered.</p>
    <p>There are a few other minor issues with the data collection methods. First of all, to determine if a property is corporate-owned, the data collectors used key-phrase matching on the owner field to filter for specific words such as "LLC" and "Corp". However, this is not always accurate--for example, a corporate owner could have a name that doesn't contain these words, or a private owner could have some of these words in their title--meaning that there may be data that was misclassified in terms of owner values, thus skewing the corporate ownership and/or owner occupancy rates. Another issue is that the data is grouped by neighborhood, whereas in reality housing data can vary across different blocks of the same neighborhood while being similar in adjacent territories of different neighborhoods--this means that, although overall variation is accounted for, there might be great differences across different blocks that are not included in the data. These are inherent issues with the dataset, which we cannot change for this assignment, but they are issues to keep in mind before applying the findings from this study to any solutions.</p>
    <p>Now that the basic data analysis has been conducted and the issues and assumptions have been acknowledged, we move on to a more in-depth analysis of the data--specifically, one that addresses our research questions.</p>
    <h3>Visualizations</h3>
    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <p>We first consider: Which neighborhoods have experienced the most dramatic increases in corporate ownership rates since 2004, and how do these changes correlate with the dominant racial demographics of these neighborhoods?</p>
    <p>We plot the corporate ownership rate change (corporate ownership rate(2024) - corporate ownership rate(2004)) for each neighborhood in a horizontal bar graph (see <b>Figure 3</b>). We also indicate the dominant race in that neighborhood by the color of its bar (the color encoding is indicated in the legend).</p>
    <p>As shown in <b>Figure 3</b>, the corporate ownership rate increased (since its value is positive) for all neighborhoods of Boston from 2004 to 2024, matching our preliminary intuition from the line graphs in <b>Figure 1</b>. This indicates a potential reason for the increase in number of evictions and the worsening of the housing affordability crisis, since higher corporate ownership rate often leads to more evictions due to rushed mass-handling of procedures in public courts, as previous sources stated.</p>
    <p>However, the amount of increase varied drastically between the different neighborhoods--the largest increase was 32% in the South Boston Waterfront neighborhood, while the smallest increase was only 10% in Hyde Park. The reasons behind this are beyond the scope of this assignment, since it would require more data about the changes that occurred in these neighborhoods over the 20 years of this study.</p>
    <p>Among the top 10 greatest rate increases, only one neighborhood was predominantly Hispanic/Latino, while the rest were predominantly White.</p>
    <image src="images/fig-3.png" style="width:70%; height:70%;"></image>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 3:</b> Bar Graph of Corporate Ownership Rate Change by Neighborhood and Dominant Racial Group. The corporate ownership rate increased (since its value is positive) for all neighborhoods of Boston from 2004 to 2024, with the largest increase being 32% in South Boston Waterfront and the smallest increase being 10% in Hyde Park. Out of the top 10 greatest rate increases, only one neighborhood was predominantly Hispanic/Latino, while the rest were predominantly White.</figcaption>
    <p>The fact that 9 out of the top 10 neighborhoods were predominantly White begs the question: is there correlation between predominant racial group and corporate ownership rate increase in neighborhoods, or is there an underlying trend of predominant racial group in Boston neighborhoods independent of their corporate ownership rates? We look at two visualizations of the dominant racial group in each neighborhood (<b>Figure 4</b>), and notice that nearly 75% of Boston's neighborhoods are predominantly White, while all other races are predominant in less than 25% of all neighborhoods. This suggests that the fact that 9 of the top 10 highest corporate ownership rate changes are in predominantly white neighborhoods is not very significant due to the Boston neighborhoods being mostly predominantly White to begin with. It is interesting to note that 9/10=90% (proportion of White neighborhoods in top 10 rate increase)>75% (approximate proportion of White neighborhoods in Boston), meaning that the percentage of top 10 increases that are White is higher than the percentage of all neighborhoods that are White--this could suggest that White neighborhoods have a higher predisposition to increasing corporate ownership rates, although there would need to be more proof to verify this statistical significance.</p>
    <image src="images/fig-4-part-1.png" style="width:40%; height:40%;"></image>
    <image src="images/fig-4-part-2.png" style="width:40%; height:40%;"></image>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 4:</b> Dominant Racial Demographic in Boston Neighborhoods. (a) (<i>Left</i>) <b>Pie Chart:</b> The angle of each sector represents the percentage of neighborhoods that have a specific predominant race, and that race is represented by the color of the sector (the color correspondences are shown in the legend). We can see that the percentage of predominantly White neighborhoods is nearly 75%, while all other percentages are less than 25%. This suggests that 9 of the top 10 highest corporate ownership rate changes occurring in predominantly white neighborhoods isn't as significant as initially assumed, although the fact that 9/10=90% (proportion of White neighborhoods in top 10 rate increase)>75% (approximate proportion of White neighborhoods in Boston), meaning that the percentage of top 10 increases that are White is higher than the percentage of all neighborhoods that are White, could suggest that White neighborhoods have a higher predisposition to increasing corporate ownership rates (there would need to be more proof to verify this statistical significance). (b) (<i>Right</i>) <b>Color-Encoded Table:</b> The color of each square represents the racial demographic that dominates the corresponding neighborhood in that row. Once again, we note the heavy majority of neighborhoods that are predominantly White, leading to a similar conclusion as in the Pie Chart.</figcaption>
    <p>However, the fact that the only neighborhood with predominantly Hispanic/Latino people, East Boston, made the top 10 list is intriguing. Without further data, the cause of this (or whether it's simply an outlier) cannot be determined, but it could suggest exploring the question: are predominantly Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods more prone to large increases in corporate ownership rates? Looking at data from other predominantly Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods (such as in other cities) or investigating East Boston in depth could lead to answers to this question.</p>
    <h4>Question 2</h4>
    <p>Next, we consider: What is the correlation between corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates across all of the Boston neighborhoods?</p>
    <p>We plot the change in corporate ownership rate from 2004 to 2024 against the change in owner occupancy rate for each neighborhood (<b>Figure 5</b>). We use the reference lines to determine if the change in the rates is positive or negative, where a value is positive if it's to the right of/above the corresponding line, and negative if it's to the left of/below the corresponding line. In line with the previous observation, all corporate ownership rates increase (change is positive), as shown by the fact that all points are to the right of the red line (which represents 0 change in corporate ownership rate). However, there are three neighborhoods (Chinatown, Roxbury, and South Boston Waterfront) that have an increase in owner occupancy rate, while the rest have a decrease in owner occupancy rate. We highlight these special cases by categorizing the neighborhoods based on whether the two rates change inversely or not: they change inversely (red points) if corporate ownership rates increase and owner occupancy rates decrease, while they don't change inversely (blue points) if corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates both increase.</p>
    <image src="images/fig-5.png" style="width:60%; height:60%;"></image>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 5:</b> Dot/Scatter Plot of Corporate Ownership Rate Change vs. Owner Occupancy Rate Change from 2004-2024 for Boston neighborhoods. Red line represents 0 change in corporate ownership rate (points to the right have a rate increase) and green line represents 0 change in owner occupancy rate (points above have a rate increase). Red points have rates that change inversely (corporate ownership increases, owner occupancy decreases), while blue points have rates that don't change inversely (both rates increase). All points are to the right of the red line, meaning all neighborhoods experience an increase in corporate ownership rate. Most points are below the green line, and therefore marked red, meaning most neighborhoods have a decrease in owner occupancy rate. The points that are marked blue are the points above the green line, which don't have an inverse relationship in their rate changes--both of the rates increased over time.</figcaption>
    <p>The fact that there are some outliers suggests potentially interesting patterns. We wish to look at the three outlier neighborhoods in more detail, which we do by posing two followup questions:</p>
    <p><b>(1)</b> What is the year-by-year trend of owner occupancy rate in these three outlier neighborhoods? Does the rate consistently increase or does it fluctuate? If it fluctuates, do they fluctuate in the same years or different years?</p>
    <p><b>(2)</b> What properties of the neighborhoods are inducive to them being outliers--as in, overall increasing owner occupancy rates?</p>
    <p>We ask question <b>(1)</b> because identifying the year(s) when owner occupancy rate increased and decreased could point us in the right direction in terms of exploring special factors in those neighborhoods that led to their increasing rates--for example, knowing that an increase occurred in a specific year might lead us to a potential event that happened in that neighborhood that year that led to the sudden increase. We ask question <b>(2)</b> because we want to know what differentiates these neighborhoods from the rest.</p>
    <p>To address question <b>(1)</b>, we plot the owner occupancy rates over time for the three outlier neighborhoods (see <b>Figure 6</b>). We notice that for Chinatown and Roxbury, the increase is quite small (around 0.02), while it's a bit bigger (around 0.05) for South Boston Waterfront. In terms of trends over the years, there's a lot of fluctuation for all three of the neighborhoods--each neighborhood experienced climbs from 2004 to 2007, and encountered drops around 2016-2018. There's significantly more fluctuation (both in amplitude and in frequency) for South Boston Waterfront than for the other two--the peak owner occupancy rate is nearly double the starting value, and there are a lot more ups and downs than in the other two neighborhoods. The reasons behind this are unclear without more historical and political context.</p>
    <image src="images/fig-6.png" style="width:60%; height:60%;"></image>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 6:</b> Owner Occupancy Rate Over Time Line Graphs For Outlier (Rate Increasing) Neighborhoods. The lines represent owner occupancy rates over time for each of the three outlier neighborhoods: Chinatown, Roxbury, and South Boston Waterfront. The increase is smaller for Chinatown and Roxbury than for South Boston Waterfront: the former neighborhoods' rates are around 0.02, while the latter neighborhood's rate is around 0.05. All of the neighborhoods have fluctuating rates (such as climbs from 2004 to 2007 and drops around 2016-2018 for each), but there's significantly more fluctuation in terms of amplitude and frequency for South Boston Waterfront--the peak owner occupancy rate is nearly double the starting value, and there are a lot more ups and downs than in the other two neighborhoods.</figcaption>
    <p>We also compare owner occupancy rates and corporate ownership rates for these neighborhoods to consider their relationship year by year (see <b>Figure 7</b>). We notice that, in Chinatown and Roxbury, the two rate changes are almost always inverted until the late 2010's, when they suddenly become mostly parallel. This is not true in South Boston Waterfront, which has more fluctuations and alternates between inverted and parallel: there is a basically parallel relationship from 2004 to 2009, then there's an inverse relationship between 2010 and 2020, and then it's mostly back to parallel until the end of the data. The trends for Chinatown and Roxbury mostly fit our original hypothesis that the rates will be inverted, until later years of the study--this opens a new research question about why the rates suddenly became parallel around 2010. On the other hand, the observations for South Boston Waterfront suggest more interesting questions about that neighborhood: specifically, what happened in South Boston Waterfront between 2009-2020 to cause the fluctuations between inverted and parallel, instead of just settling into one?</p>
    <image src="images/fig-7.png" style="width:60%; height:60%;"></image>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 7:</b> Side by Side Line Graph Comparison of Own Occ Rate and Corp Own Rate Over Time for Outlier Neighborhoods. In Chinatown and Roxbury, the two rate changes are almost always inverted until the late 2010's, when they become mostly parallel. The first part matches our inverse model, but why is it suddenly not inverted in 2010 and onwards? This is not true in South Boston Waterfront, which has more fluctuations and alternates between inverted and parallel: there is a basically parallel relationship from 2004 to 2009, then there's an inverse relationship between 2010 and 2020, and then it's mostly back to parallel until the end of the data. What caused all of these deviations from the inverse model?</figcaption>
    <p>A further question for future research is examining the impacts of COVID on the two rates in each of these outlier neighborhoods (or the others as well)--as in, looking at the changes in rates (both individually and relative to each other) from 2020 onwards.</p>
    <p>To address question <b>(2)</b>, we consider the demographic data of the outlier neighborhoods. As we saw in <b>Figure 3</b>, the dominant racial demographic in Chinatown, Roxbury, and South Boston Waterfront are AAPI, Black, and White, respectively. It's interesting that the only AAPI neighborhood, Chinatown, is one of the outlier neighborhoods--perhaps this correlation is significant. We also look at a comparison of the non-racial demographics of these neighborhoods (<b>Figure 8</b>). We plot the percentages of some non-racial demographics (as part of the entire neighborhood's population) in the outlier neighborhoods, and compare them across the neighborhoods. We notice that South Boston Waterfront has none of these demographics, such as people in correctional facilities, college students, and people in group housing, while Chinatown has some of the categories and Roxbury has nearly all. The lack of diversity in non-racial demographics in South Boston Waterfront, the middle-ground diversity in Chinatown, and the high diversity in Roxbury provide a good contrast between the three outlier neighborhoods, but there's not enough statistical significance to associate these differences with the lack of or prevalent deviations from the inverse relationship in these neighborhoods.</p>
    <image src="images/fig-8.png" style="width:60%; height:60%;"></image>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 8:</b> Bar Graph for Non-Racial Demographics in Outlier Neighborhoods. The percentages of some non-racial demographics (as part of the entire neighborhood's population) in the outlier neighborhoods, compared against each other. We notice that South Boston Waterfront has none of these demographics, such as people in correctional facilities, college students, and people in group housing, while Chinatown has some of the categories and Roxbury has nearly all. The lack of diversity in non-racial demographics in South Boston Waterfront, the middle-ground diversity in Chinatown, and the high diversity in Roxbury provide a good contrast between the three outlier neighborhoods, but there's not enough statistical significance to associate these differences with the lack of or prevalent deviations from the inverse relationship in these neighborhoods.</figcaption>
    <p>This leads us to wonder if these non-racial demographic percentages have a correlation with any of our findings so far across all of the neighborhoods in Boston. Thus, we plot the same percentages as above, but across all of the Boston neighborhoods (<b>Figure 9</b>). We notice that there's a great range in diversity across the neighborhoods--some, like Roxbury, have higher diversity (several nonzero percentages), while some, like South Boston Waterfront and East Boston, have no diversity (nearly all zero percentages). It's interesting that the three outlier neighborhoods are all significant in terms of the diversity among these demographics--Chinatown and Roxbury occupy the higher-diversity end of all neighborhoods, while South Boston Waterfront occupies the lower-diversity end of all neighborhoods. However, aside from that, the diversity or lack thereof does not directly correlate with the two rates or other aspects of the neighborhoods, at least by a brief comparison with previous figures such as <b>Figure 1</b> and <b>Figure 3</b>. This means that there needs to be further dives into these or other demographic data to determine if there's a correlation between non-racial demographic data and the data we've analyzed in depth so far.</p>

    <figcaption><b>Figure 9:</b> Bar Graph for Non-Racial Demographics in Boston Neighborhoods. The percentages of some non-racial demographics (as part of the entire neighborhood's population) in all Boston neighborhoods, compared against each other. We notice that there's a great range in diversity across the neighborhoods--some, like Roxbury, have higher diversity (several nonzero percentages), while some, like South Boston Waterfront and East Boston, have no diversity (nearly all zero percentages). It's interesting that the three outlier neighborhoods are all significant in terms of the diversity among these demographics--Chinatown and Roxbury occupy the higher-diversity end of all neighborhoods, while South Boston Waterfront occupies the lower-diversity end of all neighborhoods. However, aside from that, the diversity or lack thereof does not directly correlate with the two rates or other aspects of the neighborhoods, at least by a brief comparison with previous figures such as <b>Figure 1</b> and <b>Figure 3</b>.</figcaption>
    <p>We note that, for both <b>Figure 8</b> and <b>Figure 9</b>, the diversity (or lack thereof) in these groups does not indicate general conclusions about the diversity of the neighborhoods as a whole. These demographics are not mutually exclusive and also do not span the entire population, but they indicate some levels of diversity (or lack thereof) since they do span some demographic aspects such as occupation. Thus, they may provide some statistical significance but are in no way deterministic, and more research needs to be conducted before conclusions about the relationship between non-racial demographic data and other fields can be drawn.</p>
    <h4>Question 3</h4>
    <p>Finally, we consider: Which neighborhoods have consistently maintained low corporate ownership rates throughout the 20 years of study, and what are their dominant racial demographics?</p>
    <p>We plot the average corporate ownership rate (averaged across the 20 years of the study) in each neighborhood (see <b>Figure 10</b>). We also include a reference line for the average across Boston neighborhoods of the average corporate ownership rate in that neighborhood across the years. We find that about half of the neighborhoods are below average, while the other half are above average--this implies that the average is close to the median, which means there are no major outliers (very high or very low rates) across the neighborhoods. The top 5 neighborhoods with the lowest average corporate ownership rate across the years are West Roxbury, Roslindale, Mattapan, Hyde Park, and Jamaica Plain, which have average values ranging from about 0.04 to about 0.07. Out of these neighborhoods, three are predominantly White and two are predominantly Black. As we remember from the conclusions of <b>Figure 4</b>, these may not be very conclusive, since the White and Black demographics are the most common dominant racial demographics in Boston Neighborhoods. However, these may be taken into account later, especially as we dive deeper into analyzing the housing-related policies and actions in the top 5 neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are especially interesting because, referring back to <b>Figure 3</b>, these neighborhoods also have some of the lowest changes in Corporate Ownership Rate from 2004 to 2024. This is somewhat to be expected because lower average and smaller range are somewhat correlated, but this implies that the neighborhoods could be more resistant to change, which may make them useful models for developing reform strategies.</p>

    <figcaption><b>Figure 10:</b> Horizontal Bar Graph of Average Corporate Ownership Rate Across Years (per Neighborhood). The vertical black line is the average of average (over the years) corporate ownership rate across all Boston neighborhoods. We find that about half of the neighborhoods are below average, while the other half are above average--this implies that the average is close to the median, which means there are no major outliers (very high or very low rates) across the neighborhoods. The top 5 neighborhoods with the lowest average corporate ownership rate across the years are West Roxbury, Roslindale, Mattapan, Hyde Park, and Jamaica Plain, which have average values ranging from about 0.04 to about 0.07. Out of these neighborhoods, three are predominantly White and two are predominantly Black.</figcaption>
    <p>The findings from <b>Figure 10</b> lead to other questions. For example, does the exact demographic makeup (other than predominant race, such as racial structure or non-race related demographic data) also contribute to the low average corporate ownership rate? We looked briefly at the non-race related demographic data information in <b>Figure 8</b> and <b>Figure 9</b>, but this question still is not fully answered. Also, are the neighborhoods with overall low or overall high rates clustered geographically?</p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>There are many more unanswered questions and new directions of exploration for the dataset we analyzed. One main aspect that was not sufficiently studied was non-racial demographic data, such as age and occupation. This was intentional, in order to perform a deeper dive into the two rates and racial demographic components of the data, as well as keep the analysis at a preliminary level due to the nature of the assignment. The quality of the study was not compromised due to the brief inclusion of this data in multiple parts, but this data needs to be studied more in depth before the study can be considered fully complete (if that's ever possible).</p>
    <p>One of our major takeaways was that corporate ownership rates increased in every Boston neighborhood from 2004 to 2024, confirming that the rise of corporate landlords occurs throughout the city over the years. However, the magnitude of increase experienced a significant variation--from as low as 10% in Hyde Park to as high as 32% in South Boston Waterfront--suggesting that local factors play an important role in either mitigating or furthering the corporate "takeover". In terms of racial demographic, predominantly White neighborhoods make up the majority of both the top 10 corporate ownership rates and all of Boston's neighborhoods, and the higher proportion in the former than the latter may be significant. More importantly, the fact that East Boston--the only predominantly Hispanic/Latino neighborhood in Boston--made it into the top 10 (at position 2, in fact) raises questions about whether some communities of color were more vulnerable to corporatization changes.</p>
    <p>Regarding the relationship between corporate ownership rate and owner occupancy rate, we found strong but not perfect inverse correlation between them. The correlation was strong because the relationship was almost fully inverse in 18 out of 21 neighborhoods, and of the 3 outlier neighborhoods (Chinatown, Roxbury, and South Boston Waterfront), there were many stretches of time that experienced inverse changes in the two rates as well. However, due to the fact that the outlier neighborhoods exist and some had long stretches of parallel changes in the two rates, we realize that increasing owner occupancy and increasing corporate ownership can occur simultaneously, although how and why this is possible is not yet clear. Furthermore, the different trajectories that the rates in the 3 outlier neighborhoods take suggest the involvement of many other factors, such as neighborhood policies and community demographics (especially the data unrelated to race). The brief look into these non-racial demographics across both outlier and all neighborhoods revealed slight information, such as how the outlier neighborhoods occupy the two extremes of the diversity spectrum (although we use the term diversity loosely because the data fields we explored do not fully span any demographic aspect or the data). However, there's a long way to go before any statistical significance can be drawn from this, especially since there's no clear correlation between the "diversity" of non-racial demographics and the other data.</p>
    <p>Finally, in similar vein to the first research question, we identified the neighborhoods that had consistently low corporate ownership rates: West Roxbury, Roslindale, Mattapan, Hyde Park, and Jamaica Plain. We found that these neighborhoods also had smaller increases in corporate ownership rate over time, and that they were nearly-evenly split between predominantly White and predominantly Black populations.</p>
    <p>Future research may combine these findings with geographic data, more non-racial demographic data, and many other types of housing data to finally unveil the reasons behind high or low resistance to the rise in corporate ownership and the (often) accompanying heightened eviction rates. Additionally, another interesting direction could be examining the COVID and post-COVID trends, to reveal how COVID affected the dynamics between corporate-owned and owner-occupied housing across diverse neighborhoods of Boston.</p>
