    <h3>Dataset: Change Over Time in Corporate Ownership and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods with Census</h3>
    <p>
        This dataset provides an overview of housing ownership trends across Boston's neighborhoods over a 20-year span (2004-2024), tracking both the corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates each year using Boston's property assessment data.The dataset is also augmented with US Census data of each neighborhood's racial demographics, housing distribution, and age structure, allowing for an examination of the correlation between various ownership trends and demographic statistics.

    <h3>Initial Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Question 1: Which neighborhoods have experienced the most dramatic increases in corporate ownership rates since 2004, and how do these changes correlate with the dominant racial demographics of these neighborhoods?</b> 
            <p>
                According to the <a href="https://vis-society.github.io/theme/evictions.html">first paragraph of the subtheme page</a>, prior research indicates that corporate landlords evict tenants at higher rates than landlords living on or near the property, suggesting that rising corporate ownership rates is almost certainly a driver for high eviction rates and housing instability. Identifying neighborhoods that have experienced sharpest increases in corporate ownership rates can help pinpoint areas at greater risk for skyrocketing eviction rates that lead to housing affordability crises, and therefore more effectively determine prioritized targets for reform. Additionally, as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html?smid=pl-share">NYT article</a> highlights, eviction patterns often have strong correlation with racial demographics, such as in Richmond, which is "a city where many poor African-Americans live in low-quality housing". Thus, investigating these relationships could also reveal underlying racial inequalities in the Boston housing market.

            <b>Question 2: What is the correlation between corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates across all of the Boston neighborhoods?</b>
            <p>
                Intuitively, corporate ownership and owner occupancy seem like opposites, since only one can be true at a time: a property cannot be both owned by a company and lived in by an individual owner. Confirming this inverse correlation and understanding its strength can reveal whether increasing corporate ownership rates directly correspond to decreasing owner occupancy (and individual landlords) rates, and vice versa, or if there are other confounding factors such as other types of ownership. Increasing corporate ownership rates matters because, as the <a href="https://vis-society.github.io/theme/evictions.html">first paragraph of the subtheme page</a> and prior research states, corporate landlords evict tenants at higher rates than landlords living on or near the property, suggesting that rising corporate ownership rates is almost certainly a driver for high eviction rates and housing instability. On the other hand, decreasing owner occupancy is also bad for landlords: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html?smid=pl-share">NYT article</a> implies that corporate ownership evictions are mass-handled in a poor manner, which can lead to agencies losing more money than they would from not receiving rent. This would not happen as much with individual landlords, since the eviction proceedings are not as streamlined and hurried. Thus, examining the relationship between the two metrics across Boston neighborhoods and over time will demonstrate whether they truly occur in tandem, providing insight into the mechanisms behind shifting housing ownership in Boston.

        <li>
            <b>Question 3: Which neighborhoods have consistently maintained low corporate ownership rates throughout the 20 years of study, and what are their dominant racial demographics?</b> 
            <p>
                While most of the research so far, such as the case studies in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html?smid=pl-share">NYT article</a>, has centered on areas with rising corporate ownership and eviction rates, identifying and studying those with low corporate ownership rates is equally valuable. Neighborhoods that have maintained low corporate ownership rates over two decades can have potential protective factors that shield them from corporate development, and examining them could be useful when reforming more negatively-affected neighborhoods. Inspecting the racial demographics of these "success-story" neighborhoods contributes important information as well: if these low corporate ownership areas are usually mostly white, while neighborhoods of color have all experienced corporate ownership rate increases, this would further demonstrate the racial inequities in the housing situation in Boston.

    <h3>Discoveries and Insights</h3>
    <p>We begin our study by examining the variables, assumptions, data quality issues, and preliminary relationships. Later, we will perform a more in-depth analysis to address our research questions.</p>

    <h4>Data Attributes, Patterns, and Relationships</h4>
    <p>First, we consider the attributes of the data. The dimensions are neighborhood, of which there are 21, and year, which ranges from 2004 to 2024. The measures are the 36 demographic categories, which range from race and age to occupation, and the two central rates: corporate ownership rate and owner occupancy rate.</p>

    <p>To gain a basic overview of the data distribution and trends, we plot the changes in corporate ownership rate and owner occupancy rate over time for each neighborhood as line graphs (see <b>Figure 1</b>). The horizontal axis is the time (year), and also indicates the neighborhood, while the vertical axis represents the corporate ownership rate and owner occupancy rate corresponding to that neighborhood and year.</p>
    <p>As shown in <b>Figure 1</b>, the general trend for each neighborhood is that corporate ownership rate increases dramatically over time. This matches the general intuition, since increase in corporate ownership rate is often correlated with declining housing affordability due to increased eviction rates, and the latter has been a significant issue according to many sources (including the NYT article above).</p>
    <p>Another trend is that the two rates vary inversely--when corporate ownership rate increases, owner occupancy decreases, and vice versa. There are some exceptions to this trend as well (like Chinatown and South Boston Waterfront) but it's also the general pattern for most of the Boston neighborhoods.</p>

    <p></p> 

    <h4>Data Issues and Assumptions</h4>
    <p>Next, we look at the necessary assumptions, as well as acknowledge potential issues with the data. We notice that the value for each demographic category seems to be unchanged across the 20 year span for each neighborhood. To verify this observation, we plot the total population for each demographic category, summed across all Boston neighborhoods, for every year between 2004 and 2024 (see <b>Figure 2</b>). The x-axis represents time (year), while the y-axis represents the total population count for each demographic group.</p>
    <p>Since each group's line is flat across the entire time period, this confirms that the demographic data is indeed static across the entire study. This is somewhat corroborated by the fact that censuses are not taken every year, but it was surprising that the data didn't change over 20 years since there's usually a census every 10 years. Regardless, we will be "assuming" that the demographic data does not change over the span of this study.</p>

    <p>Now that the basic data analysis has been conducted and the issues and assumptions have been acknowledged, we move on to a more in-depth analysis of the data--specifically, one that addresses our research questions.</p>
    <h3>Visualizations</h3>
    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <p>We first consider: Which neighborhoods have experienced the most dramatic increases in corporate ownership rates since 2004, and how do these changes correlate with the dominant racial demographics of these neighborhoods?</p>
    <p>We plot the corporate ownership rate change (corporate ownership rate(2024) - corporate ownership rate(2004)) for each neighborhood in a bar graph (see <b>Figure 3</b>). We also indicate the dominant race in that neighborhood by the color of its bar (the color encoding is indicated in the legend).</p>
    <p>As shown in <b>Figure 3</b>, the corporate ownership rate increased for all neighborhoods of Boston from 2004 to 2024, matching our preliminary intuition from the line graphs (<b>Figure 1</b>). This indicates a potential reason for the increase in number of evictions and the worsening of the housing affordability crisis--as previous sources stated, higher corporate ownership rate often leads to more evictions due to rushed mass-handling of procedures in public courts.</p>
    <p>However, the amount of increase varied drastically between the different neighborhoods--the largest increase was 32% in the South Boston Waterfront neighborhood, while the smallest increase was only 10% in Hyde Park. The reasons behind this are beyond the scope of this assignment, since it would require more data about the changes that occurred in these neighborhoods over the 20 years of this study.</p>
    <p>Among the top 10 greatest rate increases, only one neighborhood was predominantly Hispanic/Latino, while the rest were predominantly White.</p>
